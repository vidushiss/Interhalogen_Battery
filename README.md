**Introduction**

IBM Research uses data-driven approaches to design and optimize electrolyte formulations for next-generation batteries. [Formulation Graph Convolution Neural Network (F-GCN)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01030) maps the structure-composition relationship of the formulation constituents to the property of liquid formulation as a whole. Here, F-GCN is extended ([extended-FGCN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01989)) to incorporate additional battery design variables like electrode composition, separator type, and temperatures, and drive electrolyte optimization for a target cathode configuration. This approach is available to support and advance data-driven discovery of battery electrolytes.

**Getting Started**

Extended-FGCN can be used for any battery experimental dataset to predict battery performance metrics such as capacity, cycle life, and CE. To get started, you can clone the repository. Detailed documentation and example python scripts to train and test the model are provided in the Model folder.

$ git clone https://github.com/vidushiss/Interhalogen_Battery.git
